## Introduction to Transport for London (TfL)

Transport for London (TfL) is the integrated transport authority responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of London's public transport network. Established in 2000, TfL oversees the iconic London Underground (Tube), buses, Docklands Light Railway (DLR), Overground trains, and the cycle hire scheme, among other services. The organization aims to keep London moving, make it safer, and improve accessibility while ensuring sustainable development in the capital. As one of the largest and most complex urban transport networks globally, TfL plays a vital role in managing public transportation, road systems, and traffic regulations to cater to millions of daily commuters.

### Overview of the Dataset

The **TfL Bus Safety Dataset** provided here contains information about safety incidents involving buses across London's transport network. This data is crucial for analyzing bus safety, identifying patterns of incidents, and improving safety measures for passengers, pedestrians, and other road users.

#### Key Columns in the Dataset:
1. **Year**: The year the incident occurred.
2. **Date Of Incident**: The specific date of the incident.
3. **Route**: The bus route number involved in the incident.
4. **Operator**: The company or organization responsible for operating the bus service.
5. **Group Name**: The parent company or group to which the operator belongs.
6. **Bus Garage**: The garage or depot where the bus is maintained.
7. **Borough**: The London borough where the incident took place.
8. **Injury Result Description**: A description of the injury sustained by the victim (e.g., minor injury, serious injury).

This dataset can be used to identify trends, such as which bus routes or operators have the most incidents, the types of injuries reported, and the locations where incidents frequently occur. Such insights can help in policy-making decisions, focusing on improving the safety and well-being of passengers and road users across London's bus network.
